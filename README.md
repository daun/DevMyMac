# DevMyMac
DevMyMac is forked from https://github.com/adamisntdead/DevMyMac, it is a script that allows the user to setup their OSX / MacOS Computer for Development

# Using the Script
To use this script, first you must install XCode, or the XCode Command Line Tools. To install the command line tools, use the command:

`xcode-select --install`

Then you can use the script!

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceeeeej/DevMyMac/master/setup.sh)"`

(Links and install information in README changed for my own use, please refer to https://github.com/adamisntdead/DevMyMac for full documentation and setup instructions)
